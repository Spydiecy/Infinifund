# Infinifund

**Infinifund** is a decentralized crowdfunding platform for urban public goods, built on Base Sepolia (ETH). It enables communities to propose, fund, and transparently manage city projects through milestone-based funding and community-driven governance.

## Project Vision

Infinifund bridges the gap between urban development and blockchain by empowering citizens, investors, and project creators to collaborate with trust and transparency. The platform ensures accountability, protects investors, and fosters collective decision-making for better cities.

## Core Features

- **Citizenship Management:**  
  Admins verify and manage citizens. Only citizens can submit projects and vote in screening rounds.

- **Project Lifecycle:**  
  Projects go through a screening round (citizen voting), then a funding round (open to all). Only approved projects are eligible for funding.

- **Milestone-Based Funding:**  
  Funds are released in stages as project creators submit milestone reports. Investors vote to approve milestone completion before funds are unlocked.

- **Investor Protection:**  
  Investors can request a bailout if fraud is suspected. If the majority agrees, remaining funds are refunded.

- **Investor Leaderboards:**  
  Showcases top investors by participation and contribution to the platform.

- **User Profiles:**  
  Users can customize profiles with avatars (IPFS), social links, and view their created and funded projects.
